# Background and Overview

Welcome to the Allora wiki!

Allora is a collaborative and interactive application that allows logged in and linked users (friends) to create a trip by searching for a destination (by city), invite friends on their trip and create activities for the trip such as places to eat, things to do, places to stay, etc. and post them to the itinerary. Friends who are part of the trip can comment and upvote/downvote activities for the mutual itinerary so that everyone can work together to create the perfect itinerary. Logged in members of the trip can also add photos to a memory board to collect memories from their trip.
